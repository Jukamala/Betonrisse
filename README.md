# Concrete Classification with Convolutions Neural Networks
This module contains many relevant tools to handle the classification and visualization of 3D concrete image data.
The goal of these tools are, among others, to efficiently detect and locate cracks in concrete samples.
This can be used as the start of a pipeline that, for example, provides image segmentation. 

The module contains tools for
- data generation
- data preprocessing / preparation
- data analysis / visualization
- models for classification
- model training
- model diagnostics / visualization

Additionally, some trained models and results are provided.

In the following, the structure of this module as well as its contents and functionality are described.

## Data generation
